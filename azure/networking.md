## What are service endpoints ? 

Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your VNet to the Azure services, over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your VNet to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

This feature is available for the following Azure services and regions:

- Azure Storage: Generally Available in all Azure regions
- Azure SQL Database: Generally Available in all Azure regions
- Azure Cosmos DB: Generally Available in all Azure public cloud regions
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse: Preview in all Azure public cloud regions
- Azure database services for PostgreSQL and MySQL: Preview in Azure regions where database service is available.
